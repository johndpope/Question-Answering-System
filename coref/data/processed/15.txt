NGC 2903 is a barred spiral galaxy discovered by William Herschel in 1784 .
NGC 2903 is very similar in size and shape to the Milky Way and is located 25 million light-years from Earth .
In NGC 2903 core , NGC 2903 has many `` hotspots '' , which have been found to be near regions of star formation .
The star formation in this region is thought to be due to the presence of the dusty bar , which sends shock waves through star formation rotation to an area with a diameter of 2,000 light-years .
The outskirts of the galaxy have many young open clusters .
