0	103	H.A. Rey has suggested an alternative way to connect the stars, which graphically shows a lion walking.
104	309	The stars delta Leonis, gamma Leonis, eta Leonis, and theta Leonis form the body of the lion, with gamma Leonis being of the second magnitude and delta Leonis and theta Leonis being of the third magnitude.
310	460	The stars gamma Leonis, zeta Leonis, mu Leonis, epsilon Leonis, and eta Leonis form the lion's neck, with epsilon Leonis being of the third magnitude.
461	556	The stars mu Leonis, kappa Leonis, lambda Leonis, and epsilon Leonis form the head of the lion.
557	699	Delta Leonis and beta Leonis form the lion's tail: beta Leonis, also known as Denebola, is the bright tip of the tail with a magnitude of two.
700	823	The stars theta Leonis, iota Leonis, and sigma Leonis form the left hind leg of the lion, with sigma Leonis being the foot.
824	918	The stars theta Leonis and rho Leonis form the right hind leg, with rho Leonis being the foot.
919	1061	The stars eta Leonis and alpha Leonis mark the lion's heart, with alpha Leonis, also known as Regulus, being the bright star of magnitude one.
1062	1139	The stars eta Leonis and omicron Leonis form the right front foot of the Lion.
