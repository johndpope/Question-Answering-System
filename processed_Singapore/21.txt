Before independence in 1965 , Singapore was the capital of the British Straits Settlements , a Crown Colony .
Singapore was also the main British naval base in East Asia .
Because Singapore was the main British naval base in the region and held the Singapore Naval Base , the largest dry dock of Singapore time , Singapore was commonly described in the press as the ` Gibraltar of the East ' .
The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 caused a major increase in trade between Europe and Asia , helping Singapore become a major world trade center , and turning the Port of Singapore into one of the largest and busiest ports in the world .
Prior to 1965 , Singapore had a GDP per capita of $ 511 , then the third-highest in East Asia .
After independence , the combination of foreign direct investment and a state-led drive for industrialisation , based on plans by Goh Keng Swee and Albert Winsemius , started the expansion of the country 's economy .
