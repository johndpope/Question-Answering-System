Singapore has the world 's highest percentage of millionaires , with one out of every six households having at least one million US dollars in disposable wealth .
This excludes property , businesses , and luxury goods , which if included would increase the number of millionaires , especially as property in Singapore is among the world 's most expensive .
Singapore does not have a minimum wage , believing that Singapore would lower Singapore competitiveness .
Singapore also has one of the highest income inequalities among developed countries , being below Hong Kong and above the United States .
