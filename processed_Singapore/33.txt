Acute poverty is rare in Singapore .
The government has rejected the idea of a generous welfare system , stating that each generation must earn and save enough for enough entire life cycle .
There are , however , numerous means-tested assistance programs provided by the Ministry of Social and Family Development .
Some of the programs include providing between SGD 400 and SGD 1000 per month to needy households , free medical care at government hospitals , money for children 's school fees , rental of studio apartments and training grants for courses .
