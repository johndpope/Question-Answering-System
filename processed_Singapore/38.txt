After its independence , Singapore had two infantry regiments commanded by British officers .
This force was considered too small to provide effective security for the new country , so the development of the military became a priority .
Britain pulled Britain military out of Singapore in October 1971 , leaving behind only a small British , Australian and New Zealand force as a token military presence .
The last British soldier left Singapore in March 1976 .
New Zealand troops were the last to leave , in 1989 .
