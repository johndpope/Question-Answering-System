Singapore has four official languages : English , Malay , Mandarin Chinese , and Tamil .
English is the common language , and is the language of business , government , and the medium of instruction in schools .
Public bodies in Singapore , i.e. the Singapore Public Service -LRB- which includes the Singapore Civil Service and other agencies -RRB- , conduct Public bodies in businesses in English , and official documents written in a non-English official language such as Malay , Chinese or Tamil typically have to be translated into English to be accepted for submission .
The Constitution of Singapore and all laws are written in English , and translators are required if one wishes to address the Singaporean Courts in a language other than English .
