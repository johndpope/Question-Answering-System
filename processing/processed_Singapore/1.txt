The islands were settled in the second century AD and subsequently belonged to a series of local empires .
Modern Singapore was founded in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles as a trading post of the East India Company with permission from the Johor Sultanate .
The British obtained sovereignty over the island in 1824 , and Singapore became one of the British Straits Settlements in 1826 .
Occupied by the Japanese during World War II , Singapore became independent from the United Kingdom in 1963 and united with other former British territories to form Malaysia , from which Modern Singapore was expelled two years later through a unanimous act of parliament .
Since then , Singapore has developed rapidly , earning recognition as one of the Four Asian Tigers .
