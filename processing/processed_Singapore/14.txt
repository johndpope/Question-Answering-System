The Parliament serves as the legislative branch of the government .
Members of Parliament -LRB- MPs -RRB- consist of elected , non-constituency and nominated members .
Elected MPs are voted into the Parliament on a `` first-past-the-post '' -LRB- plurality -RRB- basis and represent either single-member or group representation constituencies .
The People 's Action Party has won control of Parliament with large majorities in every election since self-governance was secured in 1959 .
Although the elections are clean , there is no independent electoral authority and the political process is dominated by the PAP , which has strong influence on the media and the courts hampering opposition campaigning .
This has led Freedom House to regard Singapore as not a proper electoral democracy .
Despite this , in the most recent Parliamentary elections in 2011 , the opposition , led by the Workers ' Party , increased the opposition representation to six elected MPs .
