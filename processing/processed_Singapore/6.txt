In 1819 , Thomas Stamford Raffles arrived and signed a treaty with Sultan Hussein Shah of Johor , on behalf of the British East India Company , to develop the southern part of Singapore as a British trading post .
In 1824 , the entire island became a British possession under a further treaty with the Sultan , as well as the Temenggong .
In 1826 , Singapore became part of the Straits Settlements , under the jurisdiction of British India , becoming the regional capital in 1836 .
Prior to Raffles ' arrival , there were approximately 1,000 people living on the island , mostly indigenous Malays along with a handful of Chinese .
By 1860 , the population exceeded 80,000 and more than half were Chinese .
Many immigrants came to work at rubber plantations and , after the 1870s , the island became a global center for rubber exports .
