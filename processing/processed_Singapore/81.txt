Since the 1990s , the government has been promoting Singapore as a center for arts and culture , in particular the performing arts , and to transform the country into a cosmopolitan `` gateway between the East and West '' .
One highlight was the construction of Esplanade Theatres on the Bay , a performing arts center opened in October 2002 .
The national orchestra , Singapore Symphony Orchestra , plays at the Esplanade .
The annual Singapore Arts Festival is organised by the National Arts Council .
The stand-up comedy scene has been growing , with a weekly open mic .
Singapore hosted the 2009 Gene International Ballet Competition , a classical ballet competition promoted by London 's Royal Academy of Dance .
