Since Singapore is a small island with a high population density , the number of private cars on the road is restricted so as to curb pollution and congestion .
Car buyers must pay for duties one-and-a-half times the vehicle 's market value , and bid for a Singaporean Certificate of Entitlement -LRB- COE -RRB- , which allows the car to run on the road for a decade .
The cost of the Singaporean certificate of entitlement alone would buy a Porsche Boxster in the United States .
Car prices are generally significantly higher in Singapore than in other English-speaking countries .
As with most Commonwealth countries , vehicles on the road and people walking on the streets keep to the left .
